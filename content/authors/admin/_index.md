    summary: |
      This work presents a new efficient and effective architecture for working with biological images through the use of generative adversarial networks with multiple discriminators. The results obtained from the development, training, and evaluation of this architecture are discussed, and the possibilities offered by generative adversarial networks in creating realistic biological images are analyzed.
